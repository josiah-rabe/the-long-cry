The **Thirty Years' War**,[^8] fought primarily in [Central Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Europe "Central Europe") between 1618 and 1648, was one of [the most destructive conflicts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_by_death_toll "List of wars by death toll") in human history. An estimated 4.5 to 8 million soldiers and civilians died from battle, famine, or disease, while parts of [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany "Germany") reported population declines of over 50%.[^38] Related conflicts include the [Eighty Years' War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighty_Years%27_War "Eighty Years' War"), the [War of the Mantuan Succession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_Mantuan_Succession "War of the Mantuan Succession"), the [Franco-Spanish War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco-Spanish_War_\(1635%E2%80%931659\) "Franco-Spanish War (1635–1659)"), the [Torstenson War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torstenson_War "Torstenson War"), the [Dutch–Portuguese War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch%E2%80%93Portuguese_War "Dutch–Portuguese War"), and the [Portuguese Restoration War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_Restoration_War "Portuguese Restoration War").

The war originated in the 16th-century [Reformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reformation "Reformation"), which led to religious conflict within the [Holy Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire "Holy Roman Empire"). The 1555 [Peace of Augsburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_of_Augsburg "Peace of Augsburg") attempted to resolve this by dividing the Empire into [Catholic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic "Catholic") and [Lutheran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lutheran "Lutheran") states, but the settlement was destabilised by the subsequent expansion of [Protestantism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestantism "Protestantism") beyond these boundaries. Combined with disagreements over the limits of imperial authority, religion was thus an important factor in starting the war. However, its scope and extent was largely the consequence of external drivers such as the [French–Habsburg rivalry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French%E2%80%93Habsburg_rivalry "French–Habsburg rivalry") and the [Dutch Revolt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Revolt "Dutch Revolt").[^39]

Its outbreak is generally traced to [1618](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenestrations_of_Prague "Defenestrations of Prague"),[^9] when the Catholic [Emperor Ferdinand II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Ferdinand_II "Emperor Ferdinand II") was replaced as [king of Bohemia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_of_Bohemia "King of Bohemia") by the Protestant [Frederick V of the Palatinate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_V_of_the_Palatinate "Frederick V of the Palatinate"). Although Ferdinand quickly [regained control of Bohemia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohemian_Revolt "Bohemian Revolt"), Frederick's participation expanded fighting [into the Palatinate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palatinate_campaign "Palatinate campaign"), whose strategic importance drew in the [Dutch Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Republic "Dutch Republic") and Spain, then engaged in the Eighty Years' War. In addition, the acquisition of territories within the Empire by rulers like [Christian IV of Denmark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_IV_of_Denmark "Christian IV of Denmark") and [Gustavus Adolphus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustavus_Adolphus "Gustavus Adolphus") of [Sweden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_Empire "Swedish Empire") gave them and other foreign powers an ongoing motive to intervene. Combined with fears that the Protestant religion in general was threatened, these factors turned an internal dynastic dispute into a European conflict.

The period 1618 to 1635 was primarily a [civil war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_war "Civil war") within the Holy Roman Empire, which largely ended with the [Peace of Prague](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_of_Prague_\(1635\) "Peace of Prague (1635)"). However, [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_France "Kingdom of France") 's entry into the war in [alliance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Compi%C3%A8gne_\(1635\) "Treaty of Compiègne (1635)") with Sweden turned the empire into one theatre of a wider struggle with their Habsburg rivals, [Emperor Ferdinand III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Ferdinand_III "Emperor Ferdinand III") and Spain. Fighting ended with the 1648 [Peace of Westphalia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_of_Westphalia "Peace of Westphalia"), whose terms included greater autonomy for states like [Bavaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electorate_of_Bavaria "Electorate of Bavaria") and [Saxony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electorate_of_Saxony "Electorate of Saxony"), as well as acceptance of Dutch independence by Spain. The conflict shifted the [balance of power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_of_power_\(international_relations\) "Balance of power (international relations)") in favour of France and its subsequent expansion under [Louis XIV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_XIV "Louis XIV").

## Structural origins

The 16th century [Reformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reformation "Reformation") caused [open warfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schmalkaldic_War "Schmalkaldic War") between [Protestants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestants "Protestants") and [Catholics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholics "Catholics") within the [Holy Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire "Holy Roman Empire"), which ended with the 1552 [Peace of Passau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_of_Passau "Peace of Passau"). The [Peace of Augsburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_of_Augsburg "Peace of Augsburg") in 1555 tried to prevent a recurrence by fixing boundaries between the two faiths, using the principle of *[cuius regio, eius religio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuius_regio,_eius_religio "Cuius regio, eius religio")*. States were designated as either [Lutheran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lutheran "Lutheran"), then the most usual form of Protestantism, or Catholic, based on the religion of their ruler. Other provisions protected substantial religious minorities in cities like [Donauwörth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donauw%C3%B6rth "Donauwörth"), and confirmed Lutheran ownership of property taken from the [Catholic Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church "Catholic Church") since 1552.[^40] [^10]

However, the settlement was undermined by the expansion of Protestantism into Catholic areas post-1555, particularly [Calvinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvinism "Calvinism"), a Protestant doctrine viewed with hostility by both Lutherans and Catholics.[^41] Augsburg also gave individual rulers significantly greater autonomy, allowing larger states to pursue their own objectives, which often clashed with those of central authority or external powers. Conflict sometimes superseded religion, with the Protestant states of [Saxony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electorate_of_Saxony "Electorate of Saxony") and [Brandenburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandenburg-Prussia "Brandenburg-Prussia") competing with [Denmark–Norway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark%E2%80%93Norway "Denmark–Norway") and [Sweden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_Empire "Swedish Empire") over the lucrative [Baltic trade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltic_maritime_trade_\(c._1400%E2%80%931800\) "Baltic maritime trade (c. 1400–1800)").[^42] [^11]

Reconciling these differences was hampered by fragmented political institutions, which included 300 [imperial estates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_estate "Imperial estate") distributed across Germany, the [Low Countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Countries "Low Countries"), [northern Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Italy "Northern Italy"), and present-day France.[^12] These ranged in size and importance from the seven [Prince-electors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince-elector "Prince-elector") who voted for the [Holy Roman Emperor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Roman_Emperor "Holy Roman Emperor"), down to [Prince-bishoprics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince-bishop "Prince-bishop") and [imperial cities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_imperial_city "Free imperial city") like [Hamburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburg "Hamburg").[^13] Each also belonged to a separate regional grouping known as an [Imperial Circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Circle "Imperial Circle"), which was chiefly concerned with defence, and operated independently. Above all of these was the [Imperial Diet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Diet_\(Holy_Roman_Empire\) "Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)"), which assembled infrequently, and focused on discussion, rather than legislation.[^45]

Although technically elected, since 1440, the position of emperor had been held by the [House of Habsburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Habsburg "House of Habsburg"). The largest single landowner within the Holy Roman Empire, it ruled over eight million subjects, based in territories that included [Austria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archduchy_of_Austria "Archduchy of Austria"), [Bohemia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Bohemia "Kingdom of Bohemia") and [Hungary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Hungary "Kingdom of Hungary").[^46] The Habsburgs also controlled the [Spanish Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Empire "Spanish Empire") until 1556, when [Charles V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_V,_Holy_Roman_Emperor "Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor") divided his possessions between different branches of the family. This bond was reinforced by frequent inter-marriage, while [Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habsburg_Spain "Habsburg Spain") retained territories within the Holy Roman Empire such as the [Spanish Netherlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Netherlands "Spanish Netherlands"), [Milan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchy_of_Milan "Duchy of Milan") and [Franche-Comté](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franche-Comt%C3%A9 "Franche-Comté"). However, although the two often collaborated, there was no such thing as a joint "Habsburg" policy.[^47]

This is because the two entities were very different. Spain was a global maritime superpower, stretching from Europe to the [Philippines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Philippines_\(1565%E2%80%931898\) "History of the Philippines (1565–1898)") and [the Americas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Spain "New Spain"), while Austria [^14] was a land-based power, focused on Germany and securing its eastern border against the [Ottoman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire "Ottoman Empire").[^48] Another key difference was the disparity in relative financial strength, with the Spanish Habsburgs providing large subsidies to their Austrian counterparts. The loss of these post 1640, as Spain itself struggled with the costs of a long running global war, substantially weakened the imperial position.[^49]

Prior to the Reformation, shared religion partially compensated for weak imperial institutions. After 1556, rising religious and political tensions allowed states like Lutheran Saxony and Catholic [Bavaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchy_of_Bavaria "Duchy of Bavaria") to expand their own power, while further weakening imperial authority. This internal political struggle was exacerbated by external powers with their own strategic objectives, such as Spain, the [Dutch Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Republic "Dutch Republic"), or France, confronted by Habsburg lands on its borders to the [north](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nord-Pas-de-Calais "Nord-Pas-de-Calais"), [south](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_France "Southern France"), and along the [Pyrenees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrenees "Pyrenees"). Since a number of foreign rulers were also imperial princes, divisions within the empire drew in players like [Christian IV of Denmark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_IV_of_Denmark "Christian IV of Denmark"), who joined the war in 1625 as [Duke of Holstein-Gottorp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_of_Holstein-Gottorp "Duke of Holstein-Gottorp").[^43]

Map of the Thirty Years' War

Disputes occasionally resulted in full-scale conflict like the 1583 to 1588 [Cologne War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cologne_War "Cologne War"), triggered when its [ruler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gebhard_Truchsess_von_Waldburg "Gebhard Truchsess von Waldburg") converted to [Calvinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvinism "Calvinism"). More common were events such as the 1606 Battle of the Flags in Donauwörth, when riots broke out after the Lutheran majority blocked a Catholic religious procession. [Emperor Rudolf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Rudolf "Emperor Rudolf") approved intervention by the Catholic [Maximilian of Bavaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximilian_I,_Elector_of_Bavaria "Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria"). In return, he was allowed to annex the town, and, as agreed at Augsburg, the official religion changed from Lutheran to Catholic.[^50]

When the Imperial Diet opened in February 1608, both Lutherans and Calvinists sought re-confirmation of the Augsburg settlement. In return, the Habsburg heir [Archduke Ferdinand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_II,_Holy_Roman_Emperor "Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor") required the immediate restoration of any property taken from the Catholic Church since 1555, as opposed to the previous practice whereby each case was assessed separately. By threatening all Protestants, his demand paralysed the diet and removed the perception of imperial neutrality.[^51]

The loss of faith in central authority meant towns and rulers began strengthening their fortifications and armies, with foreign travellers often commenting on the militarisation of Germany in this period.[^52] When [Frederick IV, Elector Palatine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_IV,_Elector_Palatine "Frederick IV, Elector Palatine") formed the [Protestant Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant_Union "Protestant Union") in 1608, Maximilian responded by setting up the [Catholic League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_League_\(German\) "Catholic League (German)") in July 1609. Both were largely vehicles for their leaders' dynastic ambitions, but when combined with the 1609 to 1614 [War of the Jülich Succession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_J%C3%BClich_Succession "War of the Jülich Succession"), the result was to increase tensions throughout the empire.[^53] Some historians who see the war as primarily a European conflict argue that Jülich marks its beginning, with Spain and Austria backing the Catholic candidate, France and the [Dutch Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Republic "Dutch Republic") the Protestant.[^54]

The Spanish Road Purple: Spanish dependencies Green: Ruled by Austria Brown: Ruled by Spain

External powers became involved in what was an internal German dispute because of the imminent expiry of the 1609 [Twelve Years' Truce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_Years%27_Truce "Twelve Years' Truce"), which suspended the [Eighty Years' War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighty_Years%27_War "Eighty Years' War") between Spain and the Dutch Republic. Before restarting hostilities, [Ambrosio Spinola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambrosio_Spinola "Ambrosio Spinola"), commander in the Spanish Netherlands, needed to secure the [Spanish Road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Road "Spanish Road"), an overland route connecting Habsburg possessions in Italy to [Flanders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flanders "Flanders"). This allowed him to move troops and supplies by road, rather than sea where the Dutch navy was dominant; by 1618, the only part not controlled by Spain ran through the [Electoral Palatinate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_Palatinate "Electoral Palatinate").[^55]

Since [Emperor Matthias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Matthias "Emperor Matthias") had no surviving children, in [July 1617](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O%C3%B1ate_treaty "Oñate treaty") [Philip III of Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_III_of_Spain "Philip III of Spain") agreed to support [Ferdinand II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_II,_Holy_Roman_Emperor "Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor") 's election as king of Bohemia and Hungary. In return, Ferdinand made concessions to Spain in northern Italy and Alsace, and agreed to support their offensive against the Dutch. Doing so required his election as emperor, which was not guaranteed; Maximilian of Bavaria, who opposed the increase of Spanish influence in an area he considered his own, tried to create a coalition to support his candidacy.[^56]

Another option was [Frederick V, Elector Palatine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_V,_Elector_Palatine "Frederick V, Elector Palatine"), a Calvinist who in 1613 married [Elizabeth of Bohemia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_of_Bohemia "Elizabeth of Bohemia"), daughter of [James I of England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_VI_and_I "James VI and I"). When Ferdinand was elected king of Bohemia in 1617, he also gained control of its electoral vote, but his conservative Catholicism made him unpopular with the mostly Protestant Bohemian nobility, who were also concerned about the erosion of their rights. Since the seven electors previously consisted of three Protestants and four Catholics, replacing Ferdinand with Frederick would alter the religious balance, making possible the election of a Protestant emperor and the end of Habsburg predominance.[^15] These factors combined to bring about the [Bohemian Revolt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohemian_Revolt "Bohemian Revolt") in May 1618.[^57]

#### Bohemian revolt

"Winter's King", Frederick V of the Palatinate, whose acceptance of the Bohemian crown sparked the conflict

Ferdinand once claimed he would rather see his lands destroyed than tolerate [heresy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heresy "Heresy") within them. Less than 18 months after taking control of [Styria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchy_of_Styria "Duchy of Styria") in 1595, he had eliminated Protestantism in what had been a stronghold of the [Reformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reformation "Reformation").[^58] Absorbed by their war in the Netherlands, his Spanish relatives preferred to avoid antagonising Protestants elsewhere. They recognised the dangers associated with Ferdinand's fervent Catholicism, but supported his claim due to the lack of alternatives.[^59]

Elected king of Bohemia in May 1617, Ferdinand reconfirmed [Protestant religious freedoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_of_Majesty "Letter of Majesty"), but his record in Styria led to the suspicion he was only awaiting a chance to overturn them. These concerns were heightened after a series of legal disputes over property were all decided in favour of the Catholic Church. In May 1618, Protestant nobles led by [Count Thurn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jind%C5%99ich_Maty%C3%A1%C5%A1_Thurn "Jindřich Matyáš Thurn") met in [Prague Castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague_Castle "Prague Castle") with Ferdinand's two Catholic representatives, [Vilem Slavata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilem_Slavata_of_Chlum "Vilem Slavata of Chlum") and [Jaroslav Borzita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaroslav_Borzita_of_Martinice "Jaroslav Borzita of Martinice"). In what became known as the [Third Defenestration of Prague](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Defenestration_of_Prague "Third Defenestration of Prague"), both men were thrown out of the castle windows along with their secretary [Filip Fabricius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filip_Fabricius "Filip Fabricius"), although all three survived.[^60]

Thurn established a Protestant-dominated government in Bohemia, while unrest expanded into [Silesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silesia "Silesia") and the Habsburg heartlands of [Lower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_Austria "Lower Austria") and [Upper Austria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Austria "Upper Austria"), where much of the nobility was also Protestant. Losing control of these threatened the entire Habsburg state, while in addition to its crucial electoral vote, Bohemia was one of the most prosperous areas of the Empire. Regaining control was vital for the Austrian Habsburgs, but chronic financial weakness left them dependent on Maximilian and Spain for the resources needed to achieve this.[^61]

Spanish involvement drew in the Dutch, and potentially [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_France "Kingdom of France"), although the strongly Catholic [Louis XIII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_XIII "Louis XIII") faced his own domestic [Protestant rebels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenot_rebellions "Huguenot rebellions") and refused to support them elsewhere. The revolt also provided opportunities for external opponents of the Habsburgs, including the Ottoman Empire and [Savoy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savoyard_state "Savoyard state"). Funded by Frederick and [Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Emmanuel_I,_Duke_of_Savoy "Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy"), a mercenary army under [Ernst von Mansfeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_von_Mansfeld "Ernst von Mansfeld") was sent to support the Bohemian rebels. Attempts by Maximilian and John George of Saxony to broker a negotiated solution ended when Matthias died in March 1619, since many believed the loss of his authority and influence had fatally damaged the Habsburgs.[^62]

By mid-June 1619, the Bohemian army under Thurn was outside [Vienna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna "Vienna") and despite Mansfeld's defeat at [Sablat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Sablat "Battle of Sablat"), Ferdinand's position continued to worsen.[^63] [Gabriel Bethlen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Bethlen "Gabriel Bethlen"), Calvinist [Prince of Transylvania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Transylvania "Prince of Transylvania"), invaded Hungary with Ottoman support, although the latter avoided direct involvement. This was helped by Ottoman involvement first in the [1620 Polish war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish%E2%80%93Ottoman_War_\(1620%E2%80%9321\) "Polish–Ottoman War (1620–21)"), then the [1623 to 1639 conflict with Persia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman%E2%80%93Safavid_War_\(1623%E2%80%931639\) "Ottoman–Safavid War (1623–1639)").[^64]

The Catholic counter-offensive; Tilly 's campaign

On 19 August, the Bohemian Estates rescinded Ferdinand's 1617 election as king and a week later formally offered the crown to Frederick. On 28 August, Ferdinand was elected Holy Roman Emperor, making war inevitable if Frederick accepted the Bohemian crown. Most of Frederick's advisors urged him to reject it, as did the Duke of Savoy, and his father-in-law James I.[^65]

However, he received backing from [Christian of Anhalt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_I,_Prince_of_Anhalt-Bernburg "Christian I, Prince of Anhalt-Bernburg"), along with [Maurice of Orange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice,_Prince_of_Orange "Maurice, Prince of Orange"), for whom conflict in Germany was a means to divert Spanish resources from the Netherlands. The Dutch offered subsidies to Frederick and the Protestant Union, helped raise loans for Bohemia, and provided weapons and munitions.[^66] However, wider European support failed to materialise, largely due to lack of enthusiasm for removing a legally elected ruler, regardless of religion.[^65]

Although Frederick accepted the crown and entered Prague in October 1619, his support eroded over the next few months. In July 1620, the Protestant Union proclaimed its neutrality, while John George of Saxony backed Ferdinand in return for the cession of [Lusatia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lusatia "Lusatia") and a guarantee of Lutheran rights in Bohemia. Maximilian of Bavaria funded a combined [Imperial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Army_of_the_Holy_Roman_Emperor "Imperial Army of the Holy Roman Emperor") -Catholic League army led by [Count Tilly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Tserclaes,_Count_of_Tilly "Johann Tserclaes, Count of Tilly") and [de Bucquoy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Bonaventure_de_Longueval,_2nd_Count_of_Bucquoy "Charles Bonaventure de Longueval, 2nd Count of Bucquoy"), which pacified Upper and Lower Austria and occupied western Bohemia before marching on Prague. Defeated at the [Battle of White Mountain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_White_Mountain "Battle of White Mountain") in November 1620, the Bohemian army disintegrated, and Frederick fled the country.[^67]

#### Palatinate campaign

By abandoning Frederick, the German princes hoped to restrict the dispute to Bohemia, an objective thwarted by Maximilian's dynastic ambitions. In the October 1619 [Treaty of Munich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Munich_\(1619\) "Treaty of Munich (1619)"), Ferdinand transferred the Palatinate's electoral vote to Bavaria, and allowed Maximilian to annex the [Upper Palatinate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Palatinate "Upper Palatinate").[^68] Many Protestants had supported Ferdinand because in principle they opposed the deposition of a legally elected ruler, and now objected to Frederick's removal on the same grounds. For Catholics, it presented an opportunity to regain lands and properties lost since 1555, a combination which destabilised large parts of the Empire.[^69]

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/Joachim_von_Sandrart_-_Maximilian_I%2C_Elector_of_Bavaria.jpg/500px-Joachim_von_Sandrart_-_Maximilian_I%2C_Elector_of_Bavaria.jpg)

Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria whose seizure of the Palatinate expanded the war

At the same time, Spain was drawn into the conflict due to the strategic importance of the Spanish Road for their war in the Netherlands, and its proximity to the Palatinate. When an army led by [Córdoba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonzalo_Fern%C3%A1ndez_de_C%C3%B3rdoba_\(1585%E2%80%931635\) "Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba (1585–1635)") occupied the [Lower Palatinate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_Palatinate "Lower Palatinate") in October 1619, James I sent English naval forces against Spanish colonial possessions and threatened war if Spanish troops were not withdrawn by spring 1621. These actions were primarily designed to placate his opponents in [Parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_England "Parliament of England"), who considered his pro-Spanish policy a betrayal of the Protestant cause.[^70] Spanish chief minister [Olivares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaspar_de_Guzm%C3%A1n,_Count-Duke_of_Olivares "Gaspar de Guzmán, Count-Duke of Olivares") correctly interpreted them as an invitation to open negotiations, and in return for an Anglo-Spanish alliance offered to restore Frederick to his Rhineland possessions.[^71]

Since Frederick's demand for full restitution of his lands and titles was incompatible with the Treaty of Munich, hopes of a negotiated peace quickly evaporated. Despite defeat in Bohemia, Frederick's allies included [Georg Friedrich of Baden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Frederick,_Margrave_of_Baden-Durlach "George Frederick, Margrave of Baden-Durlach") and [Christian of Brunswick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_the_Younger_of_Brunswick "Christian the Younger of Brunswick"), while the Dutch provided him with military support after the Eighty Years' War restarted in April 1621 and his father-in-law James funded an army of mercenaries under Mansfeld. However, their failure to co-ordinate effectively led to a series of defeats by Spanish and Catholic League forces, at [Wimpfen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Wimpfen "Battle of Wimpfen") in May 1622, which forced Georg Friedrich to seek peace and at [Höchst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_H%C3%B6chst "Battle of Höchst") in June, which forced Christian to meet up with Mansfeld. By November 1622, Spanish and imperial troops controlled most of the Palatinate, apart from [Frankenthal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Frankenthal "Siege of Frankenthal"), which was held by a small English garrison under Sir [Horace Vere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horace_Vere "Horace Vere"). The remnants of Mansfeld's army took refuge in the Dutch Republic, as did Frederick, who spent most of his time in [The Hague](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hague "The Hague") until his death in November 1632.[^72]

At a meeting of the Imperial Diet in February 1623, Ferdinand forced through provisions transferring Frederick's titles, lands, and electoral vote to Maximilian. He did so with support from the Catholic League, despite strong opposition from Protestant members, as well as the Spanish. The Palatinate was clearly lost; in March, James instructed Vere to surrender Frankenthal, while Tilly's victory over Christian of Brunswick at [Stadtlohn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Stadtlohn "Battle of Stadtlohn") in August completed military operations.[^73] However, Spanish and Dutch involvement in the campaign was a significant step in internationalising the war, while Frederick's removal meant other Protestant princes began discussing armed resistance to preserve their own rights and territories.[^74]

Key locations, 1625–1629 on the map of the modern federal state [Lower Saxony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_Saxony "Lower Saxony")

With Saxony dominating the [Upper Saxon Circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Saxon_Circle "Upper Saxon Circle") and [Brandenburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandenburg "Brandenburg") the [Lower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_Saxon_Circle "Lower Saxon Circle"), both *kreise* remained neutral in the early stages. However, Frederick's deposition in 1623 united the Lutheran John George of Saxony and Calvinist [George William, Elector of Brandenburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_William,_Elector_of_Brandenburg "George William, Elector of Brandenburg"), who became concerned Ferdinand intended to reclaim formerly Catholic bishoprics now held by Protestants. These fears seemed confirmed in early 1625 when Tilly returned to the Catholic church properties in [Halberstadt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Diocese_of_Halberstadt "Roman Catholic Diocese of Halberstadt") which had been Protestant since 1566.[^75]

As Duke of Holstein, Christian IV was also a member of the Lower Saxon circle, while the Danish economy relied on the Baltic trade and tolls from traffic through the [Øresund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%98resund "Øresund").[^76] In 1621, Hamburg accepted Danish "supervision", while his son [Frederick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_III_of_Denmark "Frederick III of Denmark") became joint-administrator of [Lübeck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince-bishopric_of_L%C3%BCbeck "Prince-bishopric of Lübeck"), [Bremen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince-Archbishopric_of_Bremen "Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen"), and [Verden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince-Bishopric_of_Verden "Prince-Bishopric of Verden"); possession ensured Danish control of the [Elbe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbe "Elbe") and [Weser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weser "Weser") rivers.[^77]

Ferdinand had paid [Albrecht von Wallenstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albrecht_von_Wallenstein "Albrecht von Wallenstein") for his support against Frederick with estates confiscated from the Bohemian rebels, and now contracted with him to conquer the north on a similar basis. In May 1625, the Lower Saxony *kreis* elected Christian their military commander, although not without resistance; Saxony and Brandenburg viewed Denmark and Sweden as competitors, and wanted to avoid either becoming involved in the empire. Attempts to negotiate a peaceful solution failed as the conflict in Germany became part of the wider struggle between France and their Habsburg rivals in Spain and Austria.[^26]

In the June 1624 [Treaty of Compiègne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Compi%C3%A8gne_\(1624\) "Treaty of Compiègne (1624)"), France had agreed to subsidise the Dutch war against Spain for a minimum of three years, while in the December 1625 [Treaty of The Hague](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_The_Hague_\(1625\) "Treaty of The Hague (1625)"), the Dutch and English agreed to finance Danish intervention in the Empire.[^16] Hoping to create a wider coalition against Ferdinand, the Dutch invited France, Sweden, Savoy, and the [Republic of Venice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Venice "Republic of Venice") to join, but it was overtaken by events.[^79] In early 1626, [Cardinal Richelieu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_Richelieu "Cardinal Richelieu"), main architect of the alliance, faced a new Huguenot rebellion at home and in the March [Treaty of Monzón](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Monz%C3%B3n "Treaty of Monzón"), France withdrew from northern Italy, re-opening the Spanish Road.[^80]

Danish intervention

Dutch and English subsidies enabled Christian to devise an ambitious three part campaign plan. While he led the main force down the Weser, Mansfeld would attack Wallenstein in [Magdeburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archbishopric_of_Magdeburg "Archbishopric of Magdeburg"), supported by forces led by Christian of Brunswick and [Maurice of Hesse-Kassel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice,_Landgrave_of_Hesse-Kassel "Maurice, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel"). However, Mansfeld was defeated at [Dessau Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Dessau_Bridge "Battle of Dessau Bridge") in April, and when Maurice refused to support him, Christian of Brunswick fell back on [Wolfenbüttel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfenb%C3%BCttel "Wolfenbüttel"), where he died of disease shortly after. The Danes were comprehensively beaten at [Lutter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Lutter "Battle of Lutter") in August, and Mansfeld's army dissolved after his death in November.[^81]

Many of Christian's German allies, such as [Hesse-Kassel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landgraviate_of_Hesse-Kassel "Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel"), had little interest in replacing imperial domination with Danish, while few of the Dutch or English subsidies were ever paid. [Charles I of England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England "Charles I of England") allowed Christian to recruit up to 9,000 Scottish mercenaries, but they took time to arrive, and although able to slow Wallenstein's advance were insufficient to stop him.[^82] By the end of 1627, Wallenstein had occupied [Mecklenburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecklenburg "Mecklenburg"), [Pomerania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitulation_of_Franzburg "Capitulation of Franzburg"), and [Jutland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jutland "Jutland"), and began making plans to construct a fleet capable of challenging Danish control of the Baltic. He was supported by Spain, for whom it provided an opportunity to open another front against the Dutch.[^83]

On 13 May 1628, his deputy [von Arnim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Georg_von_Arnim-Boitzenburg "Hans Georg von Arnim-Boitzenburg") besieged [Stralsund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Stralsund_\(1628\) "Siege of Stralsund (1628)"), the only port with facilities large enough to build this fleet. [Gustavus Adolphus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustavus_Adolphus "Gustavus Adolphus") responded by sending several thousand men to Stralsund under [Alexander Leslie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Leslie "Alexander Leslie"), who was also appointed governor.[^84] Von Arnim abandoned the siege on 4 August, but three weeks later Christian suffered another defeat at [Wolgast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Wolgast "Battle of Wolgast"). He began negotiations with Wallenstein, who despite his recent victories was concerned by the prospect of Swedish intervention, and thus anxious to make peace.[^85]

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/Albrecht_von_Wallenstein.jpeg/330px-Albrecht_von_Wallenstein.jpeg)

Albrecht von Wallenstein achieved great military success for the Empire but his power threatened both Ferdinand and the German princes.

With Ferdinand's resources stretched by the outbreak of the [War of the Mantuan Succession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_Mantuan_Succession "War of the Mantuan Succession"), Wallenstein persuaded him to agree relatively lenient terms in the June 1629 [Treaty of Lübeck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_L%C3%BCbeck "Treaty of Lübeck"). These allowed Christian to retain [Schleswig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchy_of_Schleswig "Duchy of Schleswig") and Holstein in return for relinquishing Bremen and Verden, and abandoning support for the German Protestants. While Denmark kept Schleswig and Holstein until [1864](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Schleswig_War "Second Schleswig War"), this effectively ended its period as a major power in the Baltic region.[^86]

Once again, the methods used to obtain victory explain why the war failed to end. Ferdinand's chronic financial weakness meant Wallenstein raised money by demanding ransoms from towns, while his men plundered the local territory, regardless of whether it belonged to allies or opponents. When Ferdinand deposed the hereditary [Duke of Mecklenburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Frederick_I,_Duke_of_Mecklenburg "Adolf Frederick I, Duke of Mecklenburg") in early 1628 and appointed Wallenstein in his place, the act united all German princes in opposition, regardless of religion. However, Maximilian's desire to retain the Palatinate meant the Catholic League argued only for a return to the position prevailing before 1627, while Protestants wanted that of 1618.[^87]

Made overconfident by success, in March 1629, Ferdinand passed an [Edict of Restitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edict_of_Restitution "Edict of Restitution"), which required all lands taken from the Catholic church after 1555 to be returned. While technically legal, politically it was extremely unwise, since doing so would alter nearly every single state boundary in north and central Germany, deny the existence of Calvinism and restore Catholicism in areas where it had not been a significant presence for nearly a century. Well aware none of the princes involved would agree, Ferdinand used the device of an imperial [edict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edict "Edict"), once again asserting his right to alter laws without consultation. This new assault on "German liberties" ensured continuing opposition and undermined his previous success.[^88]

At the same time, his Spanish allies were reluctant to antagonise German Protestants as the [Eighty Years' War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighty_Years%27_War "Eighty Years' War") had now shifted in favour of the Dutch Republic. Madrid's financial position steadily deteriorated in the 1620s, particularly after the [Dutch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_West_India_Company "Dutch West India Company") captured the [Spanish treasure fleet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_treasure_fleet "Spanish treasure fleet") at [Matanzas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_in_the_Bay_of_Matanzas "Battle in the Bay of Matanzas") in 1628. Fighting in Italy diverted Spanish resources from the Netherlands,[^89] allowing [Frederick Henry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Henry,_Prince_of_Orange "Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange") to [besiege 's-Hertogenbosch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_%27s-Hertogenbosch "Siege of 's-Hertogenbosch") in 1629. [Imperial intervention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_the_Veluwe_\(1629\) "Invasion of the Veluwe (1629)") could not prevent its fall.[^90]

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/Strasbourg_walter_gustave_adolphe.JPG/500px-Strasbourg_walter_gustave_adolphe.JPG)

Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden, known as the "Lion of the North", at the Battle of Breitenfeld in 1631

From 1626 to 1629, Gustavus was engaged in a [war with Poland–Lithuania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish%E2%80%93Swedish_War_\(1626%E2%80%931629\) "Polish–Swedish War (1626–1629)"), ruled by his Catholic cousin [Sigismund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigismund_III_Vasa "Sigismund III Vasa"), who also claimed the Swedish throne and was backed by Ferdinand II. Once this conflict ended, and with only a few minor states like [Hesse-Kassel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hesse-Kassel "Hesse-Kassel") still openly opposing Ferdinand, Gustavus became an obvious ally for Richelieu.[^91] In September 1629, the latter helped negotiate the [Truce of Altmark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truce_of_Altmark "Truce of Altmark") between Sweden and Poland, freeing Gustavus to enter the war. Partly a genuine desire to support his Protestant co-religionists, like Christian he also wanted to maximise his share of the Baltic trade that provided much of Sweden's income.[^92]

Following failed negotiations with Ferdinand II, Gustavus landed in [Pomerania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchy_of_Pomerania "Duchy of Pomerania") in June 1630 with nearly 18,000 Swedish troops. Using Stralsund as a bridgehead, he marched south along the [Oder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oder "Oder") towards [Stettin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Szczecin "Szczecin") and coerced [Bogislaw XIV, Duke of Pomerania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogislaw_XIV,_Duke_of_Pomerania "Bogislaw XIV, Duke of Pomerania"), into agreeing an [alliance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Stettin_\(1630\) "Treaty of Stettin (1630)") which secured his interests in Pomerania against his rival Sigismund.[^93] As a result, the Poles turned their attention to Russia, initiating the 1632 to 1634 [Smolensk War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smolensk_War "Smolensk War").[^94]

However, Swedish expectations of widespread German support proved unrealistic. By the end of 1630, their only new ally was the Administrator of Magdeburg, [Christian William](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_William_of_Brandenburg "Christian William of Brandenburg") whose capital was under siege by Tilly.[^95] Despite the devastation inflicted by imperial soldiers, Saxony and Brandenburg had their own ambitions in Pomerania, which clashed with those of Gustavus; previous experience also showed inviting external powers into the Empire was easier than getting them to leave.[^96]

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/Sack_of_Magdeburg_1631.jpg/500px-Sack_of_Magdeburg_1631.jpg)

The Sack of Magdeburg in 1631

Gustavus put pressure on Brandenburg by sacking Küstrin and [Frankfurt an der Oder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt_an_der_Oder "Frankfurt an der Oder"), while the [Sack of Magdeburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sack_of_Magdeburg "Sack of Magdeburg") in May 1631 provided a powerful warning of the consequences of imperial victory.[^97] Once again, Richelieu used French financial power to bridge differences between the Swedes and the German princes; the 1631 [Treaty of Bärwalde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_B%C3%A4rwalde "Treaty of Bärwalde") provided funds for the Swedes and their Protestant allies, including Hesse-Kassel, Saxony, and Brandenburg.[^98] These amounted to 400,000 [Reichstaler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichstaler "Reichstaler") per year, or one million [livres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_livre "French livre"), plus an additional 120,000 for 1630. While less than 2% of total French income, these payments boosted that of Sweden by more than 25%, and allowed Gustavus to maintain 36,000 troops.[^99]

Gustavus used this army to win victories at [Breitenfeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Breitenfeld_\(1631\) "Battle of Breitenfeld (1631)") in September 1631, then [Rain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Rain "Battle of Rain") in April 1632, where Tilly was killed.[^100] Ferdinand turned once again to Wallenstein, who realised Gustavus was overextended and established himself at [Fürth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%BCrth "Fürth"), from where he could threaten his supply lines. This led to the [Battle of the Alte Veste](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Alte_Veste "Battle of the Alte Veste") in late August, one of the largest battles of the war. An assault on the imperial camp outside the town was bloodily repulsed, arguably the greatest blunder committed by Gustavus during his German campaign.[^101]

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/Swedish_phase_map.svg/500px-Swedish_phase_map.svg.png)

Campaigns during the Swedish phase

Two months later, the Swedes fought an imperial army at [Lützen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_L%C3%BCtzen_\(1632\) "Battle of Lützen (1632)"). Both sides suffered heavy casualties, while Gustavus himself was killed and some Swedish units incurred losses of over 60%.[^102] Fighting continued until dusk when Wallenstein retreated, abandoning his artillery and wounded.[^102] Despite their losses, this allowed the Swedes to claim victory, although the result continues to be disputed.[^103] [^104]

After his death, Gustavus' policies were continued by his Chancellor [Axel Oxenstierna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axel_Oxenstierna "Axel Oxenstierna"), and [Bernard of Saxe-Weimar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_of_Saxe-Weimar "Bernard of Saxe-Weimar") and [Gustav Horn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustav_Horn,_Count_of_Pori "Gustav Horn, Count of Pori"). With French backing, Sweden and a number of smaller German states formed the [Heilbronn League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heilbronn_League "Heilbronn League") in April 1633, although Saxony and Brandenburg remained outside. In July, the Swedes and their allies defeated an Bavarian army at [Oldendorf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Oldendorf "Battle of Oldendorf").[^105] Wallenstein's critics claimed this was due to his failure to support them, while rumours spread that he was preparing to switch sides. As a result, Ferdinand II ordered his arrest in February 1634, and he was assassinated by his own officers in Cheb on 25th.[^106]

The loss of Wallenstein and his organisation left Ferdinand II reliant on Spain for military support. Since their main concern was to re-open the Spanish Road for their campaign against the Dutch, the focus of the war now shifted from the north to the Rhineland and Bavaria. [Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand of Austria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal-Infante_Ferdinand_of_Austria "Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand of Austria"), new Governor of the Spanish Netherlands, raised an army of 18,000 in Italy, which met up with an imperial force of 15,000 at Donauwörth on 2 September 1634. Four days later, they won a decisive victory over Horn and Bernard at [Nördlingen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_N%C3%B6rdlingen_\(1634\) "Battle of Nördlingen (1634)") which destroyed Swedish power in southern Germany, who now sought to make peace with the emperor.[^107]

By triggering direct French intervention, Nördlingen expanded the conflict rather than ending it. Richelieu provided the Swedes with [new subsidies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Compi%C3%A8gne_\(1635\) "Treaty of Compiègne (1635)"), hired mercenaries led by [Bernard of Saxe-Weimar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_of_Saxe-Weimar "Bernard of Saxe-Weimar") for an offensive in the Rhineland, and in May 1635 initiated the [Franco-Spanish War (1635–1659)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco-Spanish_War_\(1635%E2%80%931659\) "Franco-Spanish War (1635–1659)").[^108] A few days later, the German states and Ferdinand agreed to the [Peace of Prague](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_of_Prague_\(1635\) "Peace of Prague (1635)"). In return for withdrawing the Edict of Restitution, the Heilbronn and Catholic Leagues agreed to dissolve their forces, which were replaced by a single Imperial army, although Saxony and Bavaria retained control of their own forces. This is generally seen as the point when the war ceased to be a primarily inter-German religious conflict.[^109]

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/Cardinal_de_Richelieu_%28detail%29.jpg/345px-Cardinal_de_Richelieu_%28detail%29.jpg)

Cardinal Richelieu, French chief minister from 1624 until 1642, and creator of the anti-Habsburg alliance

In March 1635, French soldiers entered the [Valtellina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valtellina "Valtellina"), cutting the link between Spanish controlled Milan and the Empire.[^110] In May, their main army of 35,000 invaded the Spanish Netherlands, but withdrew in July after suffering 17,000 casualties. In [March 1636](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Wismar "Treaty of Wismar"), France joined the Thirty Years War as an ally of Sweden, whose loss of most of the territories gained by Gustavus and their taxes made it increasingly reliant on French financing.[^17] The Spanish then invaded northern France, causing panic in Paris before lack of supplies forced them to retreat.[^112] In 1635 John George I and the Saxons invaded Pomeranian but where beaten at [Dömitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_D%C3%B6mitz "Battle of Dömitz"), the Saxons retreated back into [Brandenburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandenburg "Brandenburg") but lost another defeat by [Johan Banér](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johan_Ban%C3%A9r "Johan Banér") at [Wittstock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Wittstock "Battle of Wittstock") on 4 October re-established Swedish predominance in northeast Germany.[^113]

Ferdinand II died in February 1637, and was succeeded by his son [Ferdinand III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_III,_Holy_Roman_Emperor "Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor"), who faced a precarious military position. Although [Matthias Gallas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthias_Gallas "Matthias Gallas") had forced Banér back to the Baltic, in March 1638 Bernard of Saxe Weimar destroyed an imperial army at [Rheinfelden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Rheinfelden "Battle of Rheinfelden"). His capture of [Breisach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Breisach "Battle of Breisach") in December secured French control of Alsace and severed the Spanish Road, forcing Gallas to divert resources there. Although [von Hatzfeldt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melchior_von_Hatzfeldt "Melchior von Hatzfeldt") defeated a combined Scots-German force at [Vlotho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Vlotho "Battle of Vlotho") in October, lack of supplies obliged Gallas to withdraw from the Baltic.[^114]

In April 1639, Banér defeated the Saxons at [Chemnitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Chemnitz "Battle of Chemnitz"), then entered Bohemia in May.[^115] To retrieve the situation, Ferdinand diverted [Piccolomini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottavio_Piccolomini "Ottavio Piccolomini") 's army from [Thionville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_of_Thionville "Relief of Thionville"), ending direct military cooperation between Austria and Spain.[^116] Pressure grew on Olivares to make peace, especially after French and Swedish gains in Germany cut the Spanish Road, forcing [Madrid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid "Madrid") to resupply their armies in Flanders by sea. Attempts to re-assert maritime control ended when the [Dutch fleet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_States_Navy "Dutch States Navy") under [Maarten Tromp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maarten_Tromp "Maarten Tromp") won a significant victory over the Spanish at the [Downs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Downs "Battle of the Downs") in October 1639.[^117] [^118]

The French occupied Spanish-controlled [Artois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artois "Artois") in 1640, while [Dutch attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch%E2%80%93Portuguese_War "Dutch–Portuguese War") on [Portuguese colonies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_Empire "Portuguese Empire"), combined with opposition to taxes, led to revolts in both [Portugal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_Restoration_War "Portuguese Restoration War") and [Catalonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reapers%27_War "Reapers' War").[^119] Olivares now argued Spain should accept Dutch independence, and focus on preventing further French gains in the Spanish Netherlands.[^120] This appeared achievable since most of the Dutch *[regenten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regenten "Regenten")* believed the war was won, the only question being the price of peace. They therefore reduced the army budget for 1640, despite objections from Frederick Henry.[^121]

Key locations 1635 to 1648 mentioned in text

After Bernard died in July 1639, his troops joined Banér's Swedish army in an ineffectual campaign along the Weser, the highlight being a surprise attack in January 1641 on the Imperial Diet in Regensburg.[^122] Forced to retreat, Banér reached [Halberstadt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halberstadt "Halberstadt") in May where he died, and despite beating off an Imperial force at [Wolfenbüttel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Wolfenb%C3%BCttel_\(1641\) "Battle of Wolfenbüttel (1641)") in June, his largely German troops mutinied due to lack of pay.[^123] The situation was saved by the arrival of [Lennart Torstensson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lennart_Torstensson "Lennart Torstensson") in November with 7,000 Swedish recruits and enough cash to satisfy the mutineers.[^124]

French victory at [Kempen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Kempen "Battle of Kempen") in January 1642 was followed by [Second Breitenfeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Breitenfeld_\(1642\) "Battle of Breitenfeld (1642)") in October 1642, where Torstensson inflicted almost 10,000 casualties on an Imperial army led by [Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archduke_Leopold_Wilhelm_of_Austria "Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria").[^125] The Swedes captured [Leipzig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leipzig "Leipzig") in December, although they failed to take [Freiberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freiberg "Freiberg"),[^126] and by 1643 the Saxon army had been reduced to a few isolated garrisons.[^127] Despite these setbacks, Ferdinand fought on, hoping to improve his position enough to exclude the imperial estates from his peace negotiations with France and Sweden, and allow him to represent the Empire as a whole.[^128]

This seemed more likely when Richelieu died in December 1642, followed by [Louis XIII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_XIII "Louis XIII") in May 1643, leaving his five-year-old son [Louis XIV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_XIV "Louis XIV") as king. However, Richelieu's policies were continued by his successor [Cardinal Mazarin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_Mazarin "Cardinal Mazarin"), while gains in Alsace allowed France to focus on the war against Spain. In 1643, the Army of Flanders invaded northern France, but were decisively beaten by [Condé](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_II_de_Bourbon,_Prince_de_Cond%C3%A9 "Louis II de Bourbon, Prince de Condé") at [Rocroi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Rocroi "Battle of Rocroi") on 19 May.[^129] This ended any prospect of re-opening the Spanish Road, and Madrid finally accepted the reality of Dutch independence.[^130]

Campaigns during the Franco-Swedish phase (until 1642)

However, Condé was unable to fully exploit his victory due to factors affecting all combatants. The devastation inflicted by 25 years of warfare meant armies spent more time foraging than fighting, forcing them to become smaller and more mobile, with a much greater emphasis on cavalry. Difficulties in gathering provisions meant campaigns started later, and restricted them to areas that could be easily supplied, usually close to rivers.[^131] In addition, the French army in Germany was shattered at [Tuttlingen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Tuttlingen "Battle of Tuttlingen") in November by Bavarian general [Franz von Mercy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_von_Mercy "Franz von Mercy").[^132]

Soon after Rocroi, Ferdinand invited Sweden and France to attend peace talks in the [Westphalian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westphalia "Westphalia") towns of [Münster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCnster "Münster") and [Osnabrück](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osnabr%C3%BCck "Osnabrück"),[^133] but negotiations were delayed when Christian of Denmark blockaded Hamburg and increased toll payments in the Baltic.[^134] This severely impacted the Dutch and Swedish economies, and in December 1643 the [Torstensson War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torstensson_War "Torstensson War") began when to stop [Christian IV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_IV_of_Denmark "Christian IV of Denmark") from mediating and sense he had raised the Sound Tolls. Torstensson and the Swedes invaded Jutland with Dutch naval support and Horn launched an invasion through [Scania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scania "Scania"). Ferdinand assembled an army under Gallas to attack the Swedes from the rear and to support Denmark, which proved a disastrous decision. Leaving [Wrangel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Gustaf_Wrangel "Carl Gustaf Wrangel") to finish the war in Denmark, in May 1644 Torstensson marched back into Germany. Gallas was unable to stop him, and the Danes sued for peace after their defeat at [Fehmarn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Fehmarn_\(1644\) "Battle of Fehmarn (1644)") in October 1644.[^135]

In August 1644, the French and Bavarian armies met in the three day [Battle of Freiburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Freiburg "Battle of Freiburg"), in which both sides suffered heavy casualties. Convinced the war could no longer be won, Maximilian now put pressure on Ferdinand to end the conflict.[^136] Shortly after peace talks restarted in November, Gallas' army disintegrated and the remnants retreated into Bohemia, where they were scattered by Torstensson at [Jankau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Jankau "Battle of Jankau") in March 1645.[^137] In May, Bavarians under von Mercy destroyed a French detachment at [Herbsthausen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Herbsthausen "Battle of Herbsthausen"), before he in turn was defeated and killed at [Second Nördlingen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_N%C3%B6rdlingen_\(1645\) "Battle of Nördlingen (1645)") in August.[^138] This left John George of Saxony isolated, who was forced to sign a six-month truce with Sweden in September, then agreed to remain neutral in the March 1646 Treaty of Eulenberg.[^139]

The final battle of the war; the Swedish Siege of Prague in 1648

Under [Turenne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_de_La_Tour_d%27Auvergne,_Viscount_of_Turenne "Henri de La Tour d'Auvergne, Viscount of Turenne"), French commander in the Rhineland, and Wrangel, who had replaced Torstensson, the French and Swedes separately invaded Bavaria in the summer of 1646.[^140] Maximilian was soon desperate to end the war he was largely responsible for starting, at which point the Spanish publicised a secret offer by Mazarin to exchange French-occupied Catalonia for the Spanish Netherlands. Angered by this duplicity, the Dutch agreed a truce with Spain in January 1647 and began to negotiate their own peace terms.[^141] Having failed to acquire the Netherlands through diplomacy, Mazarin decided to do so by force. To free up resources for the attempt, on 14 March 1647 he signed the [Truce of Ulm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truce_of_Ulm "Truce of Ulm") with Bavaria, [Cologne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electorate_of_Cologne "Electorate of Cologne") and Sweden.[^142]

The planned offensive fell apart when Turenne's mostly German troops mutinied, while Bavarian general [Johann von Werth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_von_Werth "Johann von Werth") refused to comply with the truce.[^143] Although the mutinies were quickly suppressed, Maximilian felt obliged to follow Werth's example, and in September ordered Bronckhorst-Gronsfeld to combine the remnants of the Bavarian army with Imperial troops under [von Holzappel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Melander,_Graf_von_Holzappel "Peter Melander, Graf von Holzappel").[^144] Outnumbered by a Franco-Swedish army led by Wrangel and Turenne, they were defeated at [Zusmarshausen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Zusmarshausen "Battle of Zusmarshausen") in May 1648. Holzappel was killed, and although most of his army escaped thanks to [Raimondo Montecuccoli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raimondo_Montecuccoli "Raimondo Montecuccoli"), Bavaria was left defenceless once again.[^145]

The Swedes sent a second force under [von Königsmarck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Christoff_von_K%C3%B6nigsmarck "Hans Christoff von Königsmarck") to [attack Prague](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Prague_\(1648\) "Battle of Prague (1648)"), seizing the castle and [Malá Strana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mal%C3%A1_Strana "Malá Strana") district in July. The main objective was to gain as much loot as possible before the war ended; they failed to take the [Old Town](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Town_\(Prague\) "Old Town (Prague)") but captured treasures including the *[Codex Gigas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Gigas "Codex Gigas")*, which can now be seen in Stockholm. When a Spanish offensive in Flanders ended with defeat at [Lens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Lens "Battle of Lens") in August 1648, Ferdinand finally agreed terms and on 24 October, he signed peace treaties with France and Sweden, ending the war.[^146]

#### Northern Italy

Northern Italy had been contested by France and the [Habsburgs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Habsburg "House of Habsburg") since the [end of the 15th century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Wars "Italian Wars"), as its control provided access to the vulnerable southern borders of France and Austria. In addition, large sections of the [Spanish Road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Road "Spanish Road") ran through it, a route that allowed Spain to safely move recruits and supplies from their Italian possessions to support their [war against the Dutch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighty_Years%27_War "Eighty Years' War"). This reliance on long exterior lines of communication was a strategic weakness, which the French sought to exploit by disrupting the Road. This usually involved attacks on the Spanish-held Duchy of Milan, or blocking the Alpine passes.[^147]

[Montferrat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchy_of_Montferrat "Duchy of Montferrat") and its fortress of [Casale Monferrato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casale_Monferrato "Casale Monferrato") were subsidiary territories of the [Duchy of Mantua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchy_of_Mantua "Duchy of Mantua") and their possession allowed the holder to threaten Milan. This meant when the [last duke in the direct line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincenzo_II_Gonzaga,_Duke_of_Mantua "Vincenzo II Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua") died in December 1627, France and Spain backed rival claimants, resulting in the 1628 to 1631 War of the Mantuan Succession.[^148] The French-born [Duke of Nevers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_Gonzaga,_Duke_of_Mantua "Charles I Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua") was backed by France and the Republic of Venice, his rival the [Duke of Guastalla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrante_II_Gonzaga,_Duke_of_Guastalla "Ferrante II Gonzaga, Duke of Guastalla") by Spain, Ferdinand II, Savoy and [Tuscany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Duchy_of_Tuscany "Grand Duchy of Tuscany"). While a relatively minor conflict, the struggle had a disproportionate impact on the Thirty Years War, since [Pope Urban VIII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Urban_VIII "Pope Urban VIII") viewed Habsburg expansion in Italy as a threat to the [Papal States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papal_States "Papal States"). His opposition to Ferdinand II divided the Catholic powers, and made it acceptable for France to employ Protestant allies against Austria.[^149]

In March 1629, the French stormed Savoyard positions in the Pas de Suse, lifted the Spanish siege of Casale, and captured [Pinerolo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinerolo "Pinerolo").[^150] The [Treaty of Suza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Suza "Treaty of Suza") then ceded the two fortresses to France and allowed their troops unrestricted passage through Savoyard territory, giving them control over [Piedmont](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piedmont "Piedmont") and the Alpine passes into southern France.[^151] However, as soon as the main French army withdrew in late 1629, the Spanish and Savoyards besieged Casale once again. At the same time, mercenaries funded by Ferdinand II were used in a Spanish offensive which routed the main Venetian field army, and forced Nevers to abandon Mantua. By October 1630, the French position seemed so precarious their representatives agreed the Treaty of Ratisbon. It was never ratified, as Richelieu claimed he had not approved the terms.[^152]

Several factors restored the French position in northern Italy, notably a devastating outbreak of [plague](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1629%E2%80%931631_Italian_plague "1629–1631 Italian plague"); between 1629 and 1631, over 60,000 died in [Milan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milan "Milan") and 46,000 in [Venice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice "Venice"), with proportionate losses elsewhere.[^153] Richelieu took advantage of the diversion of imperial resources to fund a [Swedish invasion of Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_intervention_in_the_Thirty_Years%27_War "Swedish intervention in the Thirty Years' War"), whose success forced the Spanish-Savoyard alliance to withdraw from Casale and sign the Treaty of Cherasco in April 1631. Nevers was confirmed as Duke of Mantua and although Richelieu's representative, Cardinal Mazarin, agreed to evacuate Pinerolo, it was later secretly returned under an agreement with [Victor Amadeus I, Duke of Savoy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Amadeus_I,_Duke_of_Savoy "Victor Amadeus I, Duke of Savoy"). With the exception of the 1639 to 1642 [Piedmontese Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piedmontese_Civil_War "Piedmontese Civil War"), this secured the French position in northern Italy for the next twenty years.[^154]

Siege and capture of Casale Monferrato by French troops, 1630

After the outbreak of the Franco-Spanish War in 1635, Richelieu supported a renewed offensive by Victor Amadeus against Milan to tie down Spanish resources. These included an unsuccessful attack on [Valenza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valenza "Valenza") in 1635, plus minor victories at [Tornavento](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Tornavento "Battle of Tornavento") and [Mombaldone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mombaldone "Mombaldone").[^155] However, the anti-Habsburg alliance in northern Italy fell apart when first Charles of Mantua died in September 1637, then Victor Amadeus in October, whose death led to a struggle for control of the Savoyard state between his widow [Christine of France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christine_of_France "Christine of France") and brothers, [Thomas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Francis,_Prince_of_Carignano "Thomas Francis, Prince of Carignano") and [Maurice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Maurice_of_Savoy "Prince Maurice of Savoy").[^156]

In 1639, their quarrel erupted into open warfare, with France backing Christine and Spain the two brothers, and resulted in the [Siege of Turin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Turin_\(1640\) "Siege of Turin (1640)"). One of the most famous military events of the 17th century, at one stage it featured no less than three different armies besieging each other. However, revolts in Portugal and Catalonia forced the Spanish to cease operations in Italy, and the war was settled on terms favourable to Christine and France.[^157]

In 1647, a French-backed rebellion succeeded in temporarily overthrowing Spanish rule in [Naples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neapolitan_Republic_\(1647\) "Neapolitan Republic (1647)"). The Spanish quickly crushed the insurrection and restored their rule over all of southern Italy, defeating multiple French expeditionary forces sent to back the rebels.[^158] However, it exposed the weakness of Spanish rule in Italy and the alienation of the local elites from Madrid. In 1650, the governor of Milan wrote that as well as widespread dissatisfaction in the south, the only one of the Italian states that could be relied on was the [Duchy of Parma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchy_of_Parma "Duchy of Parma").[^159]

#### Catalonia

Throughout the 1630s, tax increases levied to pay for the war led to protests throughout Spanish territories, which in 1640 resulted in revolts: first in Portugal, then in the [Principality of Catalonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principality_of_Catalonia "Principality of Catalonia"). Backed by France as part of Richelieu's 'war by diversion', in January 1641 the rebels proclaimed a [Catalan Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_Republic_\(1641\) "Catalan Republic (1641)").[^160] The Madrid government quickly assembled an army of 26,000 men to crush the revolt, which defeated the rebels at [Martorell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Martorell_\(1641\) "Battle of Martorell (1641)") on 23 January 1641. The French now persuaded the [Catalan Courts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_Courts "Catalan Courts") to recognise Louis XIII as [Count of Barcelona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count_of_Barcelona "Count of Barcelona"), and ruler of Catalonia.[^120]

On 26 January, a combined French-Catalan force routed a larger Spanish army at [Montjuïc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Montju%C3%AFc_\(1641\) "Battle of Montjuïc (1641)") and secured [Barcelona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona "Barcelona"). However, the rebels soon found the new French administration differed little from the old, turning the war into a three-sided contest between the Franco-Catalan elite, the rural peasantry, and the Spanish. There was little serious fighting after France took control of [Perpignan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpignan "Perpignan") and [Roussillon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roussillon "Roussillon"), establishing the current-day Franco-Spanish border in the Pyrenees. The revolt ended in 1651 when Madrid recaptured [Barcelona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Barcelona_\(1651\) "Siege of Barcelona (1651)").[^161]

#### Outside Europe

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/Philip_II%27s_realms_in_1598.png/500px-Philip_II%27s_realms_in_1598.png)

The Iberian Union; Spain's inability to protect Portuguese interests in the 1602 to 1663 Dutch–Portuguese War was a key factor in the 1640 Portuguese Restoration War.

In 1580, [Philip II of Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_II_of_Spain "Philip II of Spain") also became ruler of the Portuguese Empire, creating the [Iberian Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iberian_Union "Iberian Union"); long-standing commercial rivals, the 1602 to 1663 [Dutch–Portuguese War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch%E2%80%93Portuguese_War "Dutch–Portuguese War") was an offshoot of the Dutch fight for independence from Spain. The Portuguese dominated the trans- [Atlantic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic "Atlantic") economy known as the [Triangular trade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_trade "Triangular trade"), in which slaves were transported from [West Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Africa "West Africa") and [Portuguese Angola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_Angola "Portuguese Angola") to work on plantations in [Portuguese Brazil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_Brazil "Portuguese Brazil"), which exported sugar and tobacco to Europe. Known by Dutch historians as the 'Great Design", control of this trade would not only be extremely profitable but also deprive the Spanish of funds needed to finance their war in the Netherlands.[^162]

In 1621, the [Dutch West India Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_West_India_Company "Dutch West India Company") was formed to achieve this, and a Dutch fleet captured the Brazilian port of [Salvador, Bahia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador,_Bahia "Salvador, Bahia") in 1624. After it was retaken by the Portuguese in 1625, a second fleet established [Dutch Brazil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Brazil "Dutch Brazil") in 1630, which was not returned until 1654.[^163] In 1641, the Dutch seized Portuguese slave trading hubs in Angola and [São Tomé](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A3o_Tom%C3%A9 "São Tomé"), with support from the kingdoms of [Kongo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Kongo "Kingdom of Kongo") and [Ndongo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Ndongo "Kingdom of Ndongo"),[^164] whose position was threatened by Portuguese expansion.[^165] Although those gains proved short-lived, the Dutch retained territories elsewhere, like the [Cape Colony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Cape_Colony "Dutch Cape Colony"), as well as Portuguese trading posts on the [Gold Coast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_Gold_Coast "Portuguese Gold Coast"), in [Malacca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_Malacca "Portuguese Malacca"), on the [Malabar Coast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malabar_Coast "Malabar Coast"), the [Moluccas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moluccas "Moluccas") and [Ceylon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_Ceylon "Portuguese Ceylon").[^166]

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/Holy_Roman_Empire_1648.svg/500px-Holy_Roman_Empire_1648.svg.png)

Holy Roman Empire after the Peace of Westphalia, 1648

The final Peace of Westphalia consisted of three separate agreements. These were the [Peace of Münster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_of_M%C3%BCnster "Peace of Münster") between Spain and the Dutch Republic, the Treaty of Osnabrück between the Empire and Sweden, and the Treaty of Münster between the Empire and France. Preliminary discussions began in 1642, with a total of 109 delegations attending talks at one time or other, split between Münster and Osnabrück. After the Swedes rejected Christian of Denmark as mediator, the negotiators finally agreed on [Papal Legate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papal_Legate "Papal Legate") [Fabio Chigi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Alexander_VII "Pope Alexander VII"), and Venetian envoy [Alvise Contarini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvise_Contarini_\(diplomat\) "Alvise Contarini (diplomat)").[^167]

The first to be signed on 30 January 1648, the Peace of Münster forms part of the Westphalia settlement since the Dutch Republic was still considered imperial territory. It confirmed Dutch independence from Spain, although the Republic was not officially acknowledged as being outside the Empire until 1728.[^168] The Dutch also gained a monopoly over trade conducted through the Scheldt estuary, ensuring the commercial ascendancy of [Amsterdam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam "Amsterdam"). [Antwerp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antwerp "Antwerp"), capital of the Spanish Netherlands and previously the most important port in northern Europe, would not recover economically until the late 19th century.[^169]

The terms of the separate treaties with France and Sweden had first to be agreed by Ferdinand and the imperial estates. It has been argued they were a "major turning point in German and European...legal history", because they went beyond normal peace settlements and effected major constitutional and religious changes to the Empire itself.[^170] These negotiations were complex, with states like Saxony and Bavaria having very different views on desired outcomes, while Ferdinand continued to hope for an improvement in his military position. With Swedish troops on the verge of taking Prague, he finally signed the Peace on 24 October.[^171] [^172]

Key elements of the Peace were provisions confirming the autonomy of states within the Empire, including Ferdinand's acceptance of the supremacy of the Imperial Diet, and those seeking to prevent future religious conflict. Article 5 reconfirmed the Augsburg settlement, established 1624 as the basis, or "Normaljahr", for determining the dominant religion of a state and guaranteed freedom of worship for religious minorities. Article 7 recognised Calvinism as a Reformed faith and removed the *ius reformandi*, the requirement that if a ruler changed his religion, his subjects had to follow suit. These terms did not apply to the hereditary lands of the Habsburg monarchy, such as Lower and Upper Austria.[^173]

Signing of the Peace of Münster between Spain and the Dutch Republic, 30 January 1648

In terms of territorial concessions, Brandenburg-Prussia received [Farther Pomerania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farther_Pomerania "Farther Pomerania"), and the bishoprics of Magdeburg, Halberstadt, [Kammin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishopric_of_Kammin "Bishopric of Kammin"), and [Minden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishopric_of_Minden "Bishopric of Minden"). Frederick's son [Charles Louis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_Louis,_Elector_Palatine "Charles I Louis, Elector Palatine") regained the Lower Palatinate and became the eighth imperial elector, although Bavaria kept the Upper Palatinate and its electoral vote.[^168] In Lorraine, the [Three Bishoprics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Bishoprics "Three Bishoprics") of [Metz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince-Bishopric_of_Metz "Prince-Bishopric of Metz"), [Toul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince-Bishopric_of_Toul "Prince-Bishopric of Toul") and [Verdun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince-Bishopric_of_Verdun "Prince-Bishopric of Verdun"), occupied by France since 1552, were formally ceded, as were the cities of the [Décapole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%A9capole "Décapole") in Alsace, with the exception of [Strasbourg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strasbourg "Strasbourg") and [Mulhouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mulhouse "Mulhouse").[^139] Sweden received an indemnity of five million [thalers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thalers "Thalers"), the imperial territories of [Swedish Pomerania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_Pomerania "Swedish Pomerania"), and the Prince-bishoprics of Bremen and Verden, which also gave them a seat in the Imperial Diet.[^174]

The Peace was denounced by [Pope Innocent X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Innocent_X "Pope Innocent X"), who regarded the bishoprics ceded to France and Brandenburg as property of the Catholic church, and thus his to assign.[^175] It also disappointed many exiles by accepting Catholicism as the dominant religion in Bohemia, Upper and Lower Austria, all Protestant strongholds prior to 1618. Fighting did not end immediately, since demobilising over 200,000 soldiers took time, and the last Swedish garrison did not leave Germany until 1654.[^176] In addition, Mazarin insisted on excluding the [Burgundian Circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burgundian_Circle "Burgundian Circle") from the Treaty of Münster, allowing France to continue its campaign against Spain in the Low Countries, a war that continued until the 1659 [Treaty of the Pyrenees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_the_Pyrenees "Treaty of the Pyrenees"). The [political disintegration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deluge_\(history\) "Deluge (history)") of Poland-Lithuania led to the 1655 to 1660 [Second Northern War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Northern_War "Second Northern War") with Sweden, which also involved Denmark, Russia and Brandenburg, while two Swedish attempts to impose its control on the port of [Bremen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bremen "Bremen") failed in [1654 and 1666](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_Wars_on_Bremen "Swedish Wars on Bremen").[^177]

It has been argued the Peace established the principle known as [Westphalian sovereignty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westphalian_sovereignty "Westphalian sovereignty"), the idea of non-interference in domestic affairs by outside powers, although this has since been challenged. The 'Congress' model was used for peace negotiations at [Aix-la-Chapelle in 1668](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Aix-la-Chapelle_\(1668\) "Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668)"), [Nijmegen in 1678](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaties_of_Nijmegen "Treaties of Nijmegen"), and [Ryswick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_of_Ryswick "Peace of Ryswick") in 1697, although unlike the 19th century 'Congress' system, these were intended to end wars, rather than prevent them.[^178]

The Thirty Years' War is part of what historians sometimes call " [The General Crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_General_Crisis "The General Crisis") " of the mid-17th century, a period of sustained conflict and unrest in areas ranging from [Ming China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ming_China "Ming China") to the [British Isles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Isles "British Isles"), [Tsarist Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsardom_of_Russia "Tsardom of Russia") and the Holy Roman Empire. In each of these, fighting combined with [famine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine "Famine") and disease to inflict severe losses on local civilian populations.[^179] While the war certainly ranks as one of the worst of these events, 19th century [German nationalists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_nationalism "German nationalism") often exaggerated its impact to illustrate the dangers of a divided Germany.[^180]

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/Bev%C3%B6lkerkungsr%C3%BCckgang_im_HRRDN_nach_dem_Drei%C3%9Figj%C3%A4hrigen_Krieg.PNG/500px-Bev%C3%B6lkerkungsr%C3%BCckgang_im_HRRDN_nach_dem_Drei%C3%9Figj%C3%A4hrigen_Krieg.PNG)

Population decline within Germany, 1618 to 1648 Note: Decline includes factors such as emigration from rural to more secure urban areas and does not equate to deaths 33–66% >66%

Claims of up to 12 million deaths from a population of 18 million are no longer considered realistic, while upper estimates of material losses are not supported by contemporary evidence, or in some cases exceed prewar tax records.[^181] Regardless, modern commentators agree the war was a man-made mortality disaster previously unknown in Europe. Estimates of total deaths range from 4.5 to 8 million, most incurred after 1630 when Sweden entered the war, the vast majority being civilians.[^182]

Battles generally featured armies of around 13,000 to 20,000 each, one of the largest being Alte Veste in 1632 with a combined 70,000 to 85,000. Estimates of total combatants deployed by both sides within Germany range from an average of 80,000 to 100,000 from 1618 to 1626, peaking at 250,000 in 1632 and falling to under 160,000 by 1648.[^25]

Casualty rates for those who served in the military could be extremely high. Of 230 men conscripted from the Swedish village of [Bygdeå](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bygde%C3%A5 "Bygdeå") between 1621 and 1639, 215 are recorded as dead or missing, while another 5 returned home crippled.[^34] Historian Peter Wilson puts those killed or wounded in action at around 450,000. Research shows disease increased that number by a factor of between two and three, which suggests total military casualties ranged from 1.3 to 1.8 million.[^33] [Sociologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociologist "Sociologist") [Pitirim Sorokin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitirim_Sorokin "Pitirim Sorokin") calculates 2,071,000 military deaths, although his methodology has been disputed; of these 304,000 occurred in 1618-1625, 302,000 in 1625-1630, 314,000 in 1630-1635, and 1,151,000 in 1635-1648.[^183]

Local returns show only 3% of civilian deaths were due to military action, the major causes being starvation (12%), [bubonic plague](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubonic_plague "Bubonic plague") (64%), [typhus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhus "Typhus") (4%), and [dysentery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysentery "Dysentery") (5%).[^184] Poor harvests throughout the 1630s and repeated plundering of the same areas led to widespread famine, with reports of people eating grass, too weak to accept [alms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alms "Alms"), or resorting to [cannibalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_cannibalism "Human cannibalism").[^185] Although regular outbreaks of disease were common prior to 1618, their spread was accelerated by the influx of foreign soldiers, the shifting locations of battle fronts, and displacement of rural populations into already crowded cities.[^186] Soldiers transferred from Germany allegedly sparked the [1629–1631 Italian plague](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1629%E2%80%931631_Italian_plague "1629–1631 Italian plague"), described as the "worst mortality crisis to affect Italy during the [early modern period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_modern_period "Early modern period") ".[^187] This resulted in some 280,000 deaths, with estimates of up to a million.[^188]

Modern historians generally agree that the German areas of the Holy Roman Empire experienced an overall [population decline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_decline "Population decline") of roughly 40%, from 18 and 20 million in 1600 to between 11 and 13 million in 1650, and did not regain pre-war levels until 1750.[^189] [^190] Nearly 50% of these losses were incurred during the first period of Swedish intervention from 1630 to 1635. [The Czech lands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lands_of_the_Bohemian_Crown "Lands of the Bohemian Crown") also saw a 27% population decline, from approximately 2.95 million in 1600 to 2.15 million in 1650.[^191] The high mortality rate was partly due to the reliance of all sides on foreign mercenaries, often unpaid and required to live off the land.[^192] Lack of a sense of 'shared community' resulted in atrocities such as the destruction of Magdeburg, in turn creating large numbers of refugees who were extremely susceptible to sickness and hunger. While flight saved lives in the short-term, in the long run it often proved catastrophic.[^193]

In 1940, historian [Günther Franz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%BCnther_Franz "Günther Franz") published an analysis of data from across Germany covering the period from 1618 to 1648. Broadly confirmed by more recent work, he concluded about 40% of the civilian rural population became casualties, and 33% of the urban.[^37] These figures need to be read with care, since Franz calculated the *absolute decline* in pre and post-war populations, or 'total demographic loss'. They therefore include factors unrelated to death or disease, such as permanent migration to areas outside the Empire or lower birthrates, a common but less obvious impact of extended warfare.[^194] [^19] There were also wide regional variations, with areas of northwest Germany experiencing minimal loss of population, while those of Mecklenburg, [Pomerania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomerania "Pomerania") and [Württemberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchy_of_W%C3%BCrttemberg "Duchy of Württemberg") fell by nearly 50%.[^181]

Although some towns may have overstated their losses to avoid taxes, individual records confirm serious declines; from 1620 to 1650, the population of [Munich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich "Munich") fell from 22,000 to 17,000, that of [Augsburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augsburg "Augsburg") from 48,000 to 21,000.[^195] The financial impact is less clear; while the war caused short-term economic dislocation, especially in the period [1618 to 1623](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kipper_und_Wipper "Kipper und Wipper"), overall it accelerated existing changes in trading patterns. It does not appear to have reversed ongoing macro-economic trends, such as the reduction of price differentials between regional markets, and a greater degree of market integration across Europe.[^196] The death toll may have improved living standards for the survivors; one study shows wages in Germany increased by 40% in real terms between 1603 and 1652.[^197]

## Military developments

Innovations made by Gustavus in particular are considered part of the evolution known as the " [Military Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_Revolution "Military Revolution") ", although whether tactics or technology were at the heart of these changes is still debated.[^198] Introduced by [Maurice of Orange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice,_Prince_of_Orange "Maurice, Prince of Orange") in the 1590s, these sought to increase infantry firepower by moving from massed [columns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column_\(formation\) "Column (formation)") to [line formation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_\(formation\) "Line (formation)"). Gustavus further reduced the ten ranks used by Maurice to six, and increased the proportion of [musketeers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musketeer "Musketeer") to [pikemen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_\(weapon\) "Pike (weapon)"). He also enhanced their firepower by providing each unit with quick-firing light artillery pieces on either flank. The best example of their application in battle was the victory over Tilly's traditionally organised army at Breitenfeld in September 1631.[^199]

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/Firing_Breitenfeld_formations.jpg/500px-Firing_Breitenfeld_formations.jpg)

Breitenfeld 1631; Tilly's army (left) are deployed two companies deep, the Swedes (right) just one company deep.

Line formations were often harder to co-ordinate, as demonstrated when the supposedly obsolete Spanish [tercios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tercios "Tercios") defeated the Swedes at [Nördlingen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_N%C3%B6rdlingen_\(1634\) "Battle of Nördlingen (1634)") in 1634.[^200] Since they also lacked the offensive impact of columns, Gustavus compensated by requiring his cavalry to be far more aggressive, often employing Finnish *[Hakkapeliitta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakkapeliitta "Hakkapeliitta")* as shock troops. However, even the Swedes used columns on occasion, notably the failed assault at Alte Veste in September 1632. The line versus column debate continued into the early 19th century, and both were employed during the [Napoleonic Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleonic_Wars "Napoleonic Wars").[^201]

Such tactics needed professional soldiers, who could retain formation, reload and fire disciplined [salvos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvo "Salvo") while under attack, as well as the use of standardised weapons. The first half of the 17th century saw the publication of numerous instruction manuals showing the movements required, thirty-two for pikemen and forty-two for musketeers.[^202] In theory, it took up to six months to train infantry to operate in this way, but in reality many went into battle with far less experience.[^203] It also placed greater responsibility on junior officers who provided the vital links between senior commanders and the tactical unit. One of the first military schools designed to produce such men was set up at [Siegen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siegen "Siegen") in 1616, and others soon followed.[^203]

On the other hand, strategic thinking failed to develop at the same pace. Historian [Jeremy Black](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Black_\(historian\) "Jeremy Black (historian)") claims most campaigns were "inconclusive", since they were primarily concerned with gaining access to supplies and money for the soldiers, rather than focused strategic objectives. The disconnect between military and diplomatic goals helps explain why the war lasted so long, and peace proved so elusive.[^204] When fighting officially ended in 1648, there were still over 150,000 troops under arms within the Empire, small numbers by modern standards, but unprecedented at the time.[^27] Most 17th century states could not finance armies of this size for extended periods, forcing them to depend on "contributions" from areas they passed through.[^205]

Supplies thus became the limiting factor in planning campaigns, a problem that grew more acute as the war progressed. Armies became smaller, with a greater emphasis on cavalry that could cover greater distances and move faster, rather than slow moving infantry. Poor infrastructure also required commanders to stay close to rivers, then the primary means of bulk transportation, and meant they could not move too far from their main bases.[^206] Feeding the troops became an objective in itself, unconnected to diplomatic goals and largely uncontrolled by their central governments. The result was "armies increasingly devoid of intelligible political objectives...degenerating into travelling armed mobs, living in a symbiotic relationship with the countryside they passed through".[^207] This often conflicted with the political aims of their employers; the devastation inflicted in 1628 and 1629 by imperial troops on Brandenburg and Saxony, both nominally allies, was a major factor in their support for Swedish intervention.[^208]

Finally, some commentators argue that while the Thirty Years War certainly played its part in accelerating new tactics and technology, of greater significance was the need to fund, supply and direct permanent armies for long periods, across wide-ranging theatres. Doing so required much more sophisticated mechanisms, and led to the transfer of organised violence from "contractor" generals like Wallenstein or Mansfeld to nation states. In that sense, the truly "revolutionary" aspect of the Military Revolution was less on the tactics and technology used by soldiers, but the institutions required to support them.

The breakdown of social order caused by the war was often more significant and longer lasting than the immediate damage.[^209] The collapse of local government created landless peasants, who banded together to protect themselves from the soldiers of both sides, and led to widespread rebellions in [Upper Austria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peasants%27_War_in_Upper_Austria "Peasants' War in Upper Austria"), Bavaria and Brandenburg. Soldiers devastated one area before moving on, leaving large tracts of land empty of people and changing the ecosystem. Food shortages were worsened by an explosion in the rodent population, while Bavaria was overrun by wolves in the winter of 1638, and its crops destroyed by packs of wild pigs the following spring.[^210]

Contemporaries spoke of a "frenzy of despair" as people sought to make sense of the relentless and often random bloodshed unleashed by the war. Attributed by religious authorities to divine retribution, attempts to identify a supernatural cause led to a series of [witch-hunts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witch-hunt "Witch-hunt"), starting in Franconia in 1626, then quickly spreading to other parts of Germany.[^211] They began in the [Bishopric of Würzburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishopric_of_W%C3%BCrzburg "Bishopric of Würzburg"), an area with a history of such events going back to 1616 and now re-ignited by [Bishop von Ehrenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philipp_Adolf_von_Ehrenberg "Philipp Adolf von Ehrenberg"), a devout Catholic eager to assert the church's authority in his territories. By the time he died in 1631, [over 900 people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W%C3%BCrzburg_witch_trial "Würzburg witch trial") from all levels of society had been [executed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burned_at_the_stake "Burned at the stake").[^212]

The [Bamberg witch trials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamberg_witch_trials "Bamberg witch trials"), held in the nearby [Bishopric of Bamberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishopric_of_Bamberg "Bishopric of Bamberg") from 1626 to 1631, claimed over one thousand lives; in 1629, 274 died in the [Eichstätt witch trials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eichst%C3%A4tt_witch_trials "Eichstätt witch trials"), plus another 50 in the adjacent Duchy of [Palatinate-Neuburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palatinate-Neuburg "Palatinate-Neuburg").[^213] Elsewhere, persecution followed imperial military success, expanding into [Baden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margraviate_of_Baden "Margraviate of Baden") and the Palatinate following their reconquest by Tilly, then into the [Rhineland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhineland "Rhineland").[^214] However, the extent to which they were symptomatic of the impact of the conflict on society is debatable, since many took place in areas relatively untouched by the war. Concerned their brutality would discredit the Counter-Reformation, Ferdinand ensured active persecution largely ended by 1630.[^215]

Although the war caused immense destruction, it has also been credited with sparking a revival in German literature, including the creation of societies dedicated to "purging foreign elements" from the German language.[^216] One example is *[Simplicius Simplicissimus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplicius_Simplicissimus "Simplicius Simplicissimus")*, often suggested as one of the earliest examples of the [picaresque novel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picaresque_novel "Picaresque novel"); written by [Hans Jakob Christoffel von Grimmelshausen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Jakob_Christoffel_von_Grimmelshausen "Hans Jakob Christoffel von Grimmelshausen") in 1668, it includes a realistic portrayal of a soldier's life based on his own experiences, many of which are verified by other sources.[^217] Other less famous examples include the diaries of [Peter Hagendorf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Hagendorf "Peter Hagendorf"), a participant in the [Sack of Magdeburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sack_of_Magdeburg "Sack of Magdeburg") whose descriptions of the everyday brutalities of the war remain compelling.[^218]

For German, and to a lesser extent Czech writers, the war was remembered as a defining moment of national trauma, the 18th century poet and playwright [Friedrich Schiller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Schiller "Friedrich Schiller") being one of many to use it in their work. Variously known as the 'Great German War,' 'Great War' or 'Great Schism', for 19th and early 20th century German nationalists it showed the dangers of a divided Germany and was used to justify the creation of the [German Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Empire "German Empire") in 1871, as well as the [Greater Germanic Reich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Germanic_Reich "Greater Germanic Reich") envisaged by the [Nazis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany "Nazi Germany").[^219] [Bertolt Brecht](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertolt_Brecht "Bertolt Brecht") used it as the backdrop for his 1939 anti-war play *[Mother Courage and Her Children](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_Courage_and_Her_Children "Mother Courage and Her Children")*, while its enduring cultural resonance is illustrated by the novel *[Tyll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyll_\(novel\) "Tyll (novel)")*; written by Austro-German author [Daniel Kehlmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Kehlmann "Daniel Kehlmann") and also set during the war, it was nominated for the 2020 [Booker Prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booker_Prize "Booker Prize").[^220]

## Political consequences

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/Europe_after_the_Peace_of_Westphalia%2C_1648.jpg/500px-Europe_after_the_Peace_of_Westphalia%2C_1648.jpg)

Europe after the Peace of Westphalia, 1648

The Peace reconfirmed "German liberties", ending Habsburg attempts to convert the Holy Roman Empire into a centralised state similar to Spain. Over the next 50 years, Bavaria, Brandenburg-Prussia, Saxony and others increasingly pursued their own policies, while Sweden gained a permanent foothold in the Empire. Despite these setbacks, the Habsburg lands suffered less from the war than many others. They also became a far more coherent geographical bloc with the addition of Bohemia, and the restoration of Catholicism throughout their territories.[^221]

By laying the foundations of the modern [nation state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation_state "Nation state"), Westphalia changed the relationship between rulers and ruled, many of whom previously had multiple political and religious allegiances. After 1648, they were now understood to be subject first and foremost to the laws and edicts of their respective state authority, not the claims of any other entity, either religious or secular. This made it easier to levy national forces loyal to the state and its leader; one lesson learned from Wallenstein and the Swedish invasion was the need for their own permanent armies, and German society became far more militarised.[^222]

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/Pomerania_1653.PNG/500px-Pomerania_1653.PNG)

Swedish sovereignty over Western Pomerania (in blue) was confirmed in 1653, and finally ended only in 1815.

For Sweden, the benefits ultimately proved short-lived. Unlike French gains, which were incorporated into France, Swedish territories remained part of the Empire, and they became members of the Lower and Upper Saxon *kreis*. While this provided both seats and influence in the Imperial Diet, it also brought Sweden into direct conflict with Brandenburg-Prussia and Saxony, their competitors in Pomerania. The income from their German possessions was relatively minor, and although parts of Pomerania remained Swedish until 1815, much of it was ceded to Prussia in 1679 and 1720.[^223]

France arguably gained more from the conflict than any other power, and by 1648, most of Richelieu's objectives had been achieved. These included separation of the Spanish and Austrian Habsburgs, expansion of the French frontier into the Empire, and an end to Spanish military supremacy in northern Europe.[^224] Although the Franco-Spanish war continued until 1659, Westphalia allowed Louis XIV to begin replacing Spain as the predominant European power.[^225]

While religion remained a divisive political issue in many countries, the Thirty Years' War is arguably the last major [European](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Europe "Continental Europe") conflict where it was a primary driver. Future religious conflicts were either internal, such as the [Camisards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camisards "Camisards") revolt in southern France, or relatively minor, like the 1712 [Toggenburg War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toggenburg_War "Toggenburg War").[^226] The war created the outlines of a Europe that persisted until 1815 and beyond, most significantly the nation-state of France, along with the start of a split between Germany and a separate Austro-Hungarian bloc.[^223]
