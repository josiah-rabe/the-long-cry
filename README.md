# The Long Cry
## A Brief Introduction
"Why do bad things happen to good people?" 

We've been asking it for as long as mankind has walked this earth, and so many have tried to answer it. 

*The Long Cry* is a worldbuilding and storytelling project focused on the Confessions of the Lutheran Faith, family, survival, truth, and not least of all, the enduring force that is music. Its initial storytelling catalyst occurs in 1630 A.D. The first portion of the **Rowan and Róisín arc** (1630-1632) is currently in (slow) development, detailing their escape from war-torn Germany to Yorkshire, England.

## A Brief Guide
This repository contains, as of October 2025:
- The **Rowan and Róisín arc**, featuring a German Lutheran boy and an Irish Catholic girl who meet during the Thirty Years' War, and its dependencies: 
	- The **Plot**, which contains a file for each notable chronological or geographical landmark as the story arc progresses
	- **Character Profiles**, detailing all information about a given character
	- **Historical Research** on the Thirty Years' War, Lutheran theology, and period details
	- A set of **Artifacts**, or important physical items with notable documentation
	- **Worldbuilding notes** on essentially anything that is relevant

## A Less Brief History of Little Significance
*The Long Cry* is an ongoing project of mine. I began formulating it in late 2023 after viewing the hauntingly complete *Moonrise Kingdom* by Wes Anderson. In its original incarnation, it was a "headcanon" clone of the aforementioned, centered on two orphans escaping from an orphanage to some land that magically appeared (I guess) in Wyoming. 

In May of 2025, I revisited the idea and attempted to write the first "chapters" of the story, under the title *The Everly Variations*. That version's worldbuilding and general movement was far more complex and engaging, but a good friend of mine who is a far better writer than me talked me out of continuing. By all means, she was right. 

As of October 2025, I am introducing this concept in its third and potentially final overall state. Now named *The Long Cry* to reflect its potential for scale, it will remain without a "canonical" written story. Nonetheless, I intend to build rich story arcs that can be built upon later, when a better writer than I can breathe the breath of life into them. Its first and currently primary arc begins with the orphan Rowan, son of a late court musician, on a hero's journey set in 1630, opening in Wittenberg, Germany.

It is my aim to build a historically accurate and natural world, real and honest characters, and a plot that will take the reader willingly with it. 

## A Note on Obsidian and This Repo
This repository is designed to function as a **vault** for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), a popular knowledge-management application. All files are in Markdown (`.md`) format and utilize Obsidian's organizational features, including most notably:

- **Tags**: Files include YAML frontmatter with tags for categorization (e.g., `#character`, `#plot`, `#artifact`, `#research`)
- **Links**: Internal links connect related notes using `[[double-bracket]]` syntax

You can clone this repository and open it directly in Obsidian to explore the full interconnected structure of the world. Nevertheless, the files remain readable as standard Markdown in any text editor or on GitHub. As the repo grows, I may find it beneficial to add plugins to this vault, which I will add to a subsection of this portion of the `README`.
